# PortfolioProject1
This is my code for the **Mixed Messages** Portfolio Project through **Codecademy**. This is a very basic javascript code which should generate a random pre-set message from *a long time ago in a galaxy far far away*. Thank you for checking it out!
## Project Goals
The goals of this project included:
- Writing a javascript code that would generate a random message.
- Setting up a repository to host the code on **Github**.
- Learn through trial, error, and looking up a lot of tips on how to do all of this!
